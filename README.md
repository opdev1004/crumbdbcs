# 🥇 CrumbDB CS
Document DBMS in C#. CrumbDB is designed and built for solving a problem with data file size limits.

## 👨‍🏫 Notice

### 🎉 Releasing version 0.2.0
PLEASE USE THE LATEST VERSION.
- Added document db structured functions.
- Now store string data value instead of assigning the data value to document name and convert that to string. Requires migration.

### 📢 Note
- Support dotNet 8 and 9. Dotnet 8 is going to be supported until it is no longer compatible with the newest version of dotnet.

## 📖 Documents
None for now

## 🛠 Requirements

Tot CS is built for .net 8.0 and .net 9.0 and Windows 10. I cannot guarantee that this will work in older versions of Windows or other OS and with other tools.
